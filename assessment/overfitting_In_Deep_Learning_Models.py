# # Introduction
# 
# Overfitting occurs when you achieve a good fit of your model on the training data, while it does not generalize well on new, unseen data. In other words, the model learnt patterns specific to the training data, which are irrelevant in other data.
# 
# We can identify overfitting by looking at validation metrics, like loss or accuracy. Usually the validation metric stops improving after a certain number of epochs and begins to decrease afterwards. The training metric continues to improve because the model seeks to find the best fit for the training data.
# 
# There are several manners in which we can reduce overfitting in deep learning models. The best option is to ***get more training data***. Unfortunately, in real-world situations you often do not have this possibility due to time, budget or technical constraints.
# 
# Another way to reduce overfitting is to ***lower the capacity of the model to memorize the training data***. As such, the model will need to focus on the relevant patterns in the training data, which results in better generalization. In this post we'll discuss three options to achieve this.

# # Set-up of the project
# We start by importing the necessary packages and configuring some parameters. We will use  [Keras](https://keras.io/) to fit the deep learning models. The training data is the [Twitter US Airline Sentiment data set from Kaggle](http:// https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment).

# # Data preparation
# ### Data cleaning
# We load the csv with the tweets and perform a random shuffle. It's a good practice to shuffle the data before splitting between a train and test set. That way the sentiment classes are equally distributed over the train and test sets. We'll only keep the ***text*** column as input and the ***airline_sentiment*** column as the target. 
# 
# The next thing we'll do is ***removing stopwords***. Stopwords do not have any value for predicting the sentiment. Furthermore, as we want to build a model that can be used for other airline companies as well, we ***remove the mentions***.

# In[5]:


df = pd.read_csv(input_path / 'Tweets.csv')
df = df.reindex(np.random.permutation(df.index))  
df = df[['text', 'airline_sentiment']]
df.text = df.text.apply(remove_stopwords).apply(remove_mentions)


# ### Train-Test split
# The evaluation of the model performance needs to be done on a separate test set. As such, we can estimate how well the model generalizes. This is done with the ***train_test_split*** method of scikit-learn.

# In[6]:


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.text, df.airline_sentiment, test_size=0.1, random_state=37)
print('# Train data samples:', X_train.shape[0])
print('# Test data samples:', X_test.shape[0])
assert X_train.shape[0] == y_train.shape[0]
assert X_test.shape[0] == y_test.shape[0]


# ### Converting words to numbers
# To use the text as input for a model, we first need to convert the words into tokens, which simply means converting the words to integers that refer to an index in a dictionary. Here we will only keep the most frequent words in the training set.
# 
# We clean up the text by applying ***filters*** and putting the words to ***lowercase***. Words are separated by spaces.

# In[7]:


tk = Tokenizer(num_words=NB_WORDS,
               filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
               lower=True,
               char_level=False,
               split=' ')
tk.fit_on_texts(X_train)

print('Fitted tokenizer on {} documents'.format(tk.document_count))
print('{} words in dictionary'.format(tk.num_words))
print('Top 5 most common words are:', collections.Counter(tk.word_counts).most_common(5))


# After having created the dictionary we can convert the text of a tweet to a vector with NB_WORDS values. With ***mode=binary***, it contains an indicator whether the word appeared in the tweet or not. This is done with the ***texts_to_matrix*** method of the Tokenizer.

# In[20]:


X_train_oh = tk.texts_to_matrix(X_train, mode='binary')
X_test_oh = tk.texts_to_matrix(X_test, mode='binary')


# ### Converting the target classes to numbers
# We need to convert the target classes to numbers as well, which in turn are one-hot-encoded with the ***to_categorical*** method in Keras

# In[15]:


le = LabelEncoder()
y_train_le = le.fit_transform(y_train)
y_test_le = le.transform(y_test)
y_train_oh = to_categorical(y_train_le)
y_test_oh = to_categorical(y_test_le)

print('"{}" is converted into {}'.format(y_train[0], y_train_le[0]))
print('"{}" is converted into {}'.format(y_train_le[0], y_train_oh[0]))


# ### Splitting off a validation set
# Now that our data is ready, we split off a validation set. This validation set will be used to evaluate the model performance when we tune the parameters of the model. 

# In[16]:


X_train_rest, X_valid, y_train_rest, y_valid = train_test_split(X_train_oh, y_train_oh, test_size=0.1, random_state=37)

assert X_valid.shape[0] == y_valid.shape[0]
assert X_train_rest.shape[0] == y_train_rest.shape[0]

print('Shape of validation set:',X_valid.shape)


# # Deep learning

# ### Creating a model that overfits
# We start with a model that overfits. It has 2 densely connected layers of 64 elements. The ***input_shape*** for the first layer is equal to the number of words we kept in the dictionary and for which we created one-hot-encoded features.
# 
# As we need to predict 3 different sentiment classes, the last layer has 3 elements. The ***softmax*** activation function makes sure the three probabilities sum up to 1.
# 
# The number of parameters to train is computed as ***(nb inputs x nb elements in hidden layer) + nb bias terms***. The number of inputs for the first layer equals the number of words in our corpus. The subsequent layers have the number of outputs of the previous layer as inputs. So the number of parameters per layer are:
# * First layer : (10000 x 64) + 64 = 640064
# * Second layer : (64 x 64) + 64 = 4160
# * Last layer : (64 x 3) + 3 = 195

# In[17]:


base_model = models.Sequential()
base_model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(NB_WORDS,)))
base_model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
base_model.add(layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
base_model.name = 'Baseline model'
base_model.summary()


# Because this project is a multi-class, single-label prediction, we use ***categorical_crossentropy*** as the loss function and ***softmax*** as the final activation function. We fit the model on the train data and validate on the validation set. We run for a predetermined number of epochs and will see when the model starts to overfit.

# In[18]:


base_history = deep_model(base_model, X_train_rest, y_train_rest, X_valid, y_valid)
base_min = optimal_epoch(base_history)


# In[19]:


eval_metric(base_model, base_history, 'loss')


# In the beginning the ***validation loss*** goes down. But at epoch 3 this stops and the validation loss starts increasing rapidly. This is when the models begins to overfit. 
# 
# The ***training loss*** continues to go down and almost reaches zero at epoch 20. This is normal as the model is trained to fit the train data as good as possible.

# ### Handling overfitting
# Now, we can try to do something about the overfitting. There are different options to do that.
# * Option 1: ***reduce the network's capacity*** by removing layers or reducing the number of elements in the hidden layers
# * Option 2: apply ***regularization***, which comes down to adding a cost to the loss function for large weights
# * Option 3: use ***Dropout layers***, which will randomly remove certain features by setting them to zero

# #### Reducing the network's capacity
# Our first model has a large number of trainable parameters. The higher this number, the easier the model can memorize the target class for each training sample. Obviously, this is not ideal for generalizing on new data.
# 
# By lowering the capacity of the network, you force it to learn the patterns that matter, or that minimize the loss. On the other hand, reducing the network's capacity too much, will lead to ***underfitting***. The model will not be able to learn the relevant patterns in the train data. 
# 
# We reduce the network's capacity by removing one hidden layer and lowering the number of elements in the remaining layer to 16.

# In[22]:


reduced_model = models.Sequential()
reduced_model.add(layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(NB_WORDS,)))
reduced_model.add(layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
reduced_model.name = 'Reduced model'
reduced_model.summary()


# In[23]:


reduced_history = deep_model(reduced_model, X_train_rest, y_train_rest, X_valid, y_valid)
reduced_min = optimal_epoch(reduced_history)


# In[25]:


eval_metric(reduced_model, reduced_history, 'loss')


# We can see that it takes more epochs before the reduced model starts overfitting. The validation loss also goes up slower than our first model.

# In[26]:


compare_models_by_metric(base_model, reduced_model, base_history, reduced_history, 'val_loss')


# When we compare the validation loss of the baseline model, it is clear that the reduced model starts overfitting at a later epoch. The validation loss stays lower much longer than the baseline model. 
# 
# #### Applying regularization
# To address overfitting, we can apply weight regularization to the model. This will add a cost to the loss function of the network for large weights (or parameter values). As a result, you get a simpler model that will be forced to learn only the relevant patterns in the train data.
# 
# There are ***L1 regularization and L2 regularization***. 
# * L1 regularization will add a cost with regards to the ***absolute value of the parameters***. It will result in some of the weights to be equal to zero.
# * L2 regularization will add a cost with regards to the ***squared value of the parameters***. This results in smaller weights.
# 
# Let's try with L2 regularization.

# In[27]:


reg_model = models.Sequential()
reg_model.add(layers.Dense(64, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001), activation='relu', input_shape=(NB_WORDS,)))
reg_model.add(layers.Dense(64, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001), activation='relu'))
reg_model.add(layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
reg_model.name = 'L1 & L2 Regularization model'
reg_model.summary()


# In[28]:


reg_history = deep_model(reg_model, X_train_rest, y_train_rest, X_valid, y_valid)
reg_min = optimal_epoch(reg_history)


# For the regularized model we notice that it starts overfitting in the same epoch as the baseline model. However, the loss increases much slower afterwards.

# In[29]:


eval_metric(reg_model, reg_history, 'loss')


# In[30]:


compare_models_by_metric(base_model, reg_model, base_history, reg_history, 'val_loss')


# #### Adding dropout layers
# The last option we'll try is to add Dropout layers. A Dropout layer will randomly set output features of a layer to zero. 

# In[31]:


drop_model = models.Sequential()
drop_model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(NB_WORDS,)))
drop_model.add(layers.Dropout(0.5))
drop_model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
drop_model.add(layers.Dropout(0.5))
drop_model.add(layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
drop_model.name = 'Dropout layers model'
drop_model.summary()


# In[32]:


drop_history = deep_model(drop_model, X_train_rest, y_train_rest, X_valid, y_valid)
drop_min = optimal_epoch(drop_history)


# In[33]:


eval_metric(drop_model, drop_history, 'loss')


# The model with dropout layers starts overfitting later than the baseline model. The loss also increases slower than the baseline model.

# In[34]:


compare_models_by_metric(base_model, drop_model, base_history, drop_history, 'val_loss')


# The model with the Dropout layers starts overfitting later. Compared to the baseline model the loss also remains much lower.

# ### Training on the full train data and evaluation on test data
# At first sight the reduced model seems to be the best model for generalization. But let's check that on the test set.

# In[41]:


base_results = test_model(base_model, X_train_oh, y_train_oh, X_test_oh, y_test_oh, base_min)


# In[42]:


reduced_results = test_model(reduced_model, X_train_oh, y_train_oh, X_test_oh, y_test_oh, reduced_min)


# In[43]:


reg_results = test_model(reg_model, X_train_oh, y_train_oh, X_test_oh, y_test_oh, reg_min)


# In[44]:


drop_results = test_model(drop_model, X_train_oh, y_train_oh, X_test_oh, y_test_oh, drop_min)


# # Conclusion
# As shown above, all three options help to reduce overfitting. We manage to increase the accuracy on the test data substantially. Among these three options, the model with the Dropout layers performs the best on the test data.
